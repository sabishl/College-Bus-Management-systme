For my college project, I developed a comprehensive "College Bus Reservation System" utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application is designed to streamline and enhance the process of reserving transportation for college students.

The project comprises three primary components: a home page, a login page, and a bus reservation system application form.

Home Page: The home page serves as the initial touchpoint for users, providing essential information about the college and its transportation services. It features an intuitive layout, designed with clean and modern aesthetics using HTML and CSS. The page includes key details such as college history, transportation options, and contact information, ensuring that users have all the necessary information at their fingertips.

Login Page: Following the home page, users are directed to a secure login page. This page requires users to enter their credentials to access the reservation system. Implemented with JavaScript for client-side validation, the login page ensures a secure and user-friendly experience. This step is crucial for protecting user data and personalizing the reservation process.

Bus Reservation System Application Form: Upon successful login, users are directed to the bus reservation system application form. This form allows students to reserve their seats on the college bus with ease. The form is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive features and validation. Users can select their desired bus routes, dates, and seat preferences, making the reservation process straightforward and efficient. JavaScript enhances the form's functionality by providing real-time feedback and validation to ensure accurate and complete submissions.

In summary, the "College Bus Reservation System" project integrates fundamental web technologies to create a user-centric platform for managing college transportation. The seamless flow from information dissemination to secure login and efficient reservation exemplifies a well-designed application aimed at improving the overall student experience.
